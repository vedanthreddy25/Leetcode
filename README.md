# 🗃️ 30-Day SQL LeetCode Challenge 💻

Welcome to my **30-day SQL challenge**! 🚀  
The goal of this challenge is to solve one SQL question from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/) every day, focusing on interview-relevant problems that test knowledge in **SELECT**, **JOIN**, **GROUP BY**, **RANK**, **subqueries**, and more.

This is my personal journey to stay accountable and consistently upskill in SQL — a crucial skill for data science, analytics, and backend engineering roles.

---

## 🔥 Challenge Rules

- 🧠 Solve **1 SQL problem per day** for 30 consecutive days.
- 💬 Push my solution to GitHub with explanations if needed.
- 📌 Problems cover a wide range of SQL topics from **basic SELECT** to **advanced window functions**.
- 📈 Consistency over complexity — the goal is habit-building and depth of understanding.
